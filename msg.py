## naming variable -> 
# meaningful
# start with a letter (should be lowercase, because uppercase would be used in Class) or underscore. 
# number can be used after it but any other characters is invalid
# underscore to separate more than one (snake case is preferred, camel case is valid)
# case sensitive (start with )
